## 💻 Smart Contract Details

### 🔧 Functions

#### **Staking**
- `stake(uint256 amount)`: Stake your FAT tokens to earn rewards. 💎
- `unstake(uint256 amount)`: Unstake your FAT tokens along with accrued rewards (after the cooldown period). 🎁
- `calculateRewards(address user)`: View your pending staking rewards. 📊

#### **Freeze Mechanism**
- `isFreezePeriodOver()`: Check if the team tokens are still frozen. ❄️
- `unfreezeTokens()`: Admin-only function to release frozen team tokens once the freeze period is over. 🔓

#### **Add to Staking Pool**
- `addToStakingPool(uint256 amount)`: Admin-only function to add more tokens to the staking pool. 🏦 This ensures that the staking rewards remain sustainable for the community. 💪

  **Usage:**
  - Transfers the specified amount of FAT tokens from the admin to the contract address.
  - Updates the staking pool balance.

  **Requirements:**
  - The `amount` must be greater than zero.
  - The admin must have a sufficient balance to perform the transfer.

  **Event:**
  - `StakingPoolFilluped(address indexed admin, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when tokens are added to the staking pool. 🎉

#### **Special Easter Egg** 🥚
- `strokeFatCatCat()`: Displays a cute ASCII art of the Fat Cat. 😺
